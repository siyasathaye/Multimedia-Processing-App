# Multimedia Processing App 🎨🎵

A Python-based multimedia processing toolkit for manipulating **images and audio files**.  
This project demonstrates skills in **image processing**, **audio manipulation**, and efficient **NumPy-based computation**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Processing**
  - Load and convert images using the PIL library
  - Access and modify raw RGB pixel data
  - Save processed images back to disk
- **Audio Processing**
  - Read and write `.wav` audio files
  - Perform basic signal manipulations using the `wave` and `struct` libraries
- **Core Technologies**
  - `NumPy` for numerical and matrix operations  
  - `Pillow (PIL)` for image handling  
  - `wave` and `struct` for working with raw audio data  

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Object-oriented programming in Python  
- Working with binary and multimedia data  
- Data transformation using arrays and lists  
- File I/O and data serialization  
- Code modularity and reusable utility functions
